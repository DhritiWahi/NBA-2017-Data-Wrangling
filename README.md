This NBA 2017 Data Wrangling project involves processing and analyzing data from the 2017 NBA season. The project merges season statistics with player information, corrects mismatches, and performs various data cleaning tasks. These include renaming teams to their full names, converting player birthdates to datetime objects, and filtering out players associated with multiple teams.

Subsequent analysis steps explore key insights, such as identifying teams with the most players, lowest field goals, and best field goal percentage. It also examines differences in three-point shooting accuracy by position, finds the top scorers for each team, and determines the team with the youngest average player age. The project emphasizes both data accuracy and meaningful basketball insights.
